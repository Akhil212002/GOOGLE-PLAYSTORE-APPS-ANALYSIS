# Optimal-Character-Recognition
Our project includes the data visualization and prediction of data for a dataset. We have taken our dataset from kaggle and our dataset name is Google Play Store Apps. It is a Web scraped data of 10 thousand Play Store apps for analysing the Android market. In this dataset we have 10841 rows and 13 columns. We have first analyzed and explored the data by plotting various variables. And we have got many applications in play store where it is difficult to predict their ratings. To make it easy and accurate we have predicted the ratings of apps through machine learning algorithms like linear regression and random forest regression. And from the regression results, we opted the best score and concluded the best result of both the app ratings obtained using ML algorithms where we have considered some of the variables from the dataset like No of Downloads, reviews, size and more for predicting.
